# Fine-Tuning Arabic LLMs for Grammatically Accurate Text Generation in Early Childhood Education

## 📌 Introduction

Arabic is a morphologically rich, diglossic language with limited resources in the LLM era. While over 400 million people speak Arabic, most pretraining corpora contain very little Arabic data. Key challenges in building Arabic LLMs include:

- Scarcity of large-scale Arabic datasets
- Complex morphology and syntax
- Differences between MSA and dialects
- Lack of culturally aligned benchmarks

The goal of this review is to explore recent (2023–2025) work in fine-tuning **Arabic-native large language models (<7B)** for **accurate, grammatically correct generation**, especially in the context of **children’s educational texts**.

## 🧠 Arabic-Native LLMs Under 7B

| Model        | Params | Language | Strategy | Notes |
|--------------|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **AceGPT**   | 7B     | Arabic   | Continued pretraining on Arabic + SFT + GPT-4 generated Arabic data | High fluency and alignment |
| **ArabianGPT** | 0.3B–1.3B | Arabic | Pretrained on custom tokenization + Aranizer tokenizer | Lightweight but limited |
| **ALLaM**    | 7B     | Bilingual | Arabic/English pretraining + curated post-training | Balanced between generality and Arabic specificity |
| **Jais**     | 13B    | Arabic   | Pretrained on bilingual corpus + SFT on Arabic + RL alignment | Powerful but large |
| **Juhaina**  | 9.2B   | Bilingual | Continued pretraining on GEMMA + SFT + RLHF | Culturally safe and grammatically accurate |
| **Arcee-Meraj** | 72B  | Arabic-tuned | Self-curated + DPO | Closed-source, highest benchmark performance |

> ✅ **Recommendation:** AceGPT and ArabianGPT are viable sub-7B open-source models to start fine-tuning.

## 📚 Datasets Used

- **Translated instruction datasets**: Alpaca, FLAN, SuperNI → Arabic
- **Synthetic GPT-4 generated prompts** (e.g., AceGPT): more fluent
- **QALB**: Grammatical Error Correction
- **Tashkeela**: Diacritized Arabic corpus
- **NativeQA / SafetyQA**: From Jais (authentic Arabic QA + safety)
- **MADAR / NADI**: Dialectal corpora
- **Children's stories or textbooks**: Scarce publicly, may need custom curation

## 🛠️ Fine-Tuning Strategies

| Method | Description | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** | Train on instruction-response pairs | Straightforward, effective | Needs high-quality paired data |
| **Synthetic data generation** | Use GPT-4 to generate Arabic content | Fluent, low cost | May contain subtle errors |
| **Continued Pretraining** | Further pretrain on Arabic-only corpus | Boosts fluency & vocab | Computationally expensive |
| **RLHF** | Use human feedback to align model | Enhances helpfulness & safety | Costly, hard to scale |
| **DPO** | Fine-tune on preferred responses | Simpler than RLHF | Still needs preference data |
| **LoRA/QLoRA** | Parameter-efficient adapters | Can train large models on small GPUs | Slightly less capacity than full fine-tuning |

## 📊 Evaluation Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Type | Strengths | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **ALUE** | Classification | MSA focus | Similar to GLUE |
| **Dolphin** | Generative | Dialogue, QA, summarization | Great for story/text gen |
| **OALL** | QA / MCQ | Evaluates diverse LLM tasks | Popular leaderboard |
| **CamelEval** | Open-ended eval + GPT-judge | Culturally aware, human-like | Ideal for qualitative evaluation |
| **QALB** | GEC | Measures grammar F1 | Can evaluate corrections |
| **Tashkeela** | Diacritization | Phonetic accuracy | Grammar aid |

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Start with Arabic-native or Arabic-adapted base model** (AceGPT, Jais, ArabianGPT)
2. **Continue pretraining** if base model is multilingual
3. Use **synthetic + real instruction data** (GPT-4 or children’s story corpus)
4. Apply **LoRA or QLoRA** for affordable fine-tuning
5. **Evaluate with Dolphin, OALL, QALB**, and if possible, human educators
6. Ensure **cultural and educational alignment**

---

## 🔬 Limitations in Existing Work

- Overreliance on translated datasets
- Weak support for Arabic dialects or spoken forms
- Few benchmarks for educational/child-focused generation
- High-resource methods (RLHF, full tuning) less reproducible

---

## 🧭 Next Steps for Your Project

1. **Collect or build a corpus** of Arabic educational texts for children (MSA, grammar-rich)
2. Choose a **small-to-mid Arabic LLM** (e.g., AceGPT 7B, ArabianGPT 1.3B)
3. Fine-tune using **instruction tuning + grammar-focused GEC objectives**
4. Evaluate on **Dolphin (generative), QALB (grammar), CamelEval (judged fluency)**
